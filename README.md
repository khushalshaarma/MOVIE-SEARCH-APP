Movie Villa â€“ A Stylish React-Based Movie Search and Favorites Web App
Overview:
Movie Villa is a modern, responsive, and visually appealing movie discovery application built using ReactJS. It allows users to search for movies, explore trending genres, and save their favorite titles. The app fetches real-time movie data from the OMDb API, providing an intuitive and dynamic user experience with an elegant user interface, genre filtering, and persistent favorites management.

Features:
1 Live Movie Search:
Users can search for movies using keywords. The app sends asynchronous requests to the OMDb API and displays matching results in a grid layout, including posters, titles, genres, and release years.

2 Genre Filtering:
A toggleable genre panel lets users explore popular genres like Action, Comedy, Drama, Horror, Romance, Sci-Fi, and Thriller. On selecting a genre, the app fetches and displays relevant movies.

3 Favorites Panel:
Users can mark any movie as a favorite by clicking a heart icon. Favorites are displayed in a fixed panel and persist during the session for quick access.

4 Beautiful UI with Blur Background:
The app features a full-screen blurred background image, creating a cinematic ambiance. The UI elements are styled using custom CSS with modern typography, gradients, and shadow effects.

5 Responsive Design:
The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, including mobile and tablet views. CSS media queries ensure that components resize, stack, or reposition appropriately.
